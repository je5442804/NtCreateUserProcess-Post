# NtCreateUserProcess-Post
NtCreateUserProcess with CsrClientCallServer for mainstream Windows x64 version.  

Reimplement this: NtCreateUserProcess->BasepConstructSxsCreateProcessMessage->  
->CsrCaptureMessageMultiUnicodeStringsInPlace->CsrClientCallServer

This project could be useless, however it's also useful to learn!  

I'll try to fix some known bugs, Any questions,suggestions and pulls are welcomed :).  
Maybe I will try to support all Windows x64 verison from win 7 to win 11.  

# Example
(1) NtCreateUserProcess-Post.exe (Default is C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe)  
(2) NtCreateUserProcess-Post.exe C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe  
(3) NtCreateUserProcess-Post.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe"  

## Reverse Engineering
After the release of https://github.com/D0pam1ne705/Direct-NtCreateUserProcess and article by D0pam1ne705,  
I think I should also share my the Reverse Engineering results of CreateProcessInternalW (there's no need to keep it private).  
Different from his reverse route, I didn't kernel debug ALPC and csrss.exe,  
but mainly depends on IDA and memory analysis parameter.

## My Build Environment
Visual Studio 2022 (Visual Studio 2019 should work)  
Relase x64

## BasepConstructSxsCreateProcessMessage??
Well, if you think this one is complex and redundant, you can reffer D0pam1ne705 Project 
and simplify the project code without BasepConstructSxsCreateProcessMessage.

## Tested on (Only x64):

 Windows 10 1909 x64 (18363.2274)  
 Windows Server 2019 x64 (17763.107)  
 Windows Server 2016 x64 (14393)  
 Windows Server 2012 R2 x64 (9600)  
 Windows Server 2012 x64 (9200)
