# NtCreateUserProcess-Post
NtCreateUserProcess with CsrClientCallServer for mainstream Windows x64 version.  
Maybe I will try to support all Windows x64 verison from win 7 to win 11.  
This project could be useless, however it's also useful to learn!  
Any questions,suggestions and pulls are welcomed .


# Reverse Engineering
After the release of https://github.com/D0pam1ne705/Direct-NtCreateUserProcess and article by d0pam1ne705,  
I think I should also share my the Reverse Engineering results of CreateProcessInternalW (there's no need to hide it).  
Different from his reverse route, I didn't kernel debug ALPC and csrss.exe,  
but mainly depends on IDA and memory analysis parameter.

# My Build Environment
Visual Studio 2022 (Visual Studio 2019 should work)
